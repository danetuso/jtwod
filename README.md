### Building

To build the library, clone the repository and use the provided build script.

* Use the `--debug` flag to compile the library with the source in tact. This will give you access to the Java doc comments for the library.
* Use the `--release` flag to compile the library without this documentation, at a much smaller size.

#### Unix

```sh
$ ./build.sh (--release | --debug)
```

#### Windows

```sh
C:\> build.bat (--release | --debug)
```
